# 📻 AM Radio Receiver – Six Transistor Kit Build

This repository documents my build of a **Six Transistor AM/MW Radio Receiver** using a solderless breadboard kit purchased from [UsefulComponents](https://usefulcomponents.etsy.com).

Built entirely on a plug-in breadboard with discrete components, this AM radio project demonstrates the core principles of analog signal reception and amplification using basic electronic components.
